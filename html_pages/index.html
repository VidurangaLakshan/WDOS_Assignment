            <h2>Why Sri Lanka?</h2>
            <p>Sri Lanka has long been recognized as one of the world's best places to witness the nesting and hatching
                of sea turtles due to several reasons. The country's sandy beaches provide ideal nesting grounds for
                five of the world's seven species of sea turtles, including the critically endangered Hawksbill and
                Leatherback turtles. Moreover, Sri Lanka's warm tropical climate, which promotes year-round breeding,
                along with the country's conservation efforts, have made it a prime destination for those interested in
                witnessing the incredible sight of sea turtles hatching and making their way to the ocean.</p>

            <h2>Turtle Hatcheries in Sri Lanka</h2>
            <p>
                Turtle hatcheries in Sri Lanka are conservation projects that protect and care for sea turtle eggs and
                hatchlings until they are strong enough to survive on their own in the ocean. These hatcheries collect
                eggs from vulnerable nests and provide a safe and controlled environment for the eggs to hatch. Once the
                hatchlings are born, they are kept in tanks until they are strong enough to be released into the ocean.
                These hatcheries play a vital role in the conservation of Sri Lanka's sea turtle population, which is
                under threat due to habitat loss, poaching, and pollution.</p>

            <ul type="square">
                <li>
                    <p>Fishing practices: Turtles are often caught in fishing nets and on longlines, which can injure or
                        kill them.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Climate change: Rising temperatures and sea levels can alter nesting beaches and feeding grounds,
                        and make it more difficult for turtles to survive.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Poaching: Turtle eggs, meat, and shells are still highly valued in some parts of the world,
                        leading to illegal poaching and trafficking of turtles and their products.</p>
                </li>
                <li>
                    <p>Habitat loss: The destruction of natural habitats, such as nesting beaches and feeding grounds,
                        can have a devastating impact on turtle populations.</p>
